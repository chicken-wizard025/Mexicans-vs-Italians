            <p>Mexicans vs Italians is a very fun game invented by Ayaan Sethi and Eamon Burke
               and is one of the most popular and the best game in the Murrumbeena playground in 2023.
               The Dungeons and Dragons like story currently follows Jose (played by Eamon) a 42 year old mexican father and ex - soldier,
                Bartholemew(played by Ayaan) Jose's 8 year old son, Bertram (played by yours truly)
                Bartholemew's 19 year old adopted older brother, and Johnny Steve (played by Zach Grebler)
                 a stray dog taken in by Bertrem which has a special
                ability that it can detect landmines by smelling the ground. </p>

                Our main charcters are also running from the Italian Army which are invading Mexico due to it's natural
                 resources and to kill a drug cartel kingpin who has caused anarchy in the Vatican.
                They are now wanted fugitives and cannot stay in the same place for too long or they'll get captured and
                likely executed by the Italians (apart from Johnny Steve because he's a literal dog). They have recently 
                taken down an Italian base which they are curently using as their's, but Italian forces are closing in
                 on Mexico and Central America in genral so they'll soon have to migrate to the US in search of refuge.
